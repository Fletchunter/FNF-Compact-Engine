## Introduction 

Hello, I'm Fletchunter.

This is my project, FNF Compact Engine.

My main goal with this project is to make modding in FNF simple, like in Psych, Kade, and any other engine.
Coding in FNF was the most fun I've ever had. I was inspired by the community's great coding skills.



*If everything is optimized, such as by reworking other stuff and making it more simple, I'll start adding some features.*

## To-Do List

**Features**

* More settings. aka Prefs
* Improve Chart editor
* stage class (to make it more easy to add stages)
* stage editor
* custom note type
* replay system
* result system (show result after end of the song)
* history system (similar to result system, saves your gameplay history, different than replay system)
* character editor(more like debugging)
